# caldavHeatControl

Used to replace multiple old Bosch TRZ-12W heating control units in a church.

Each unit controls a valve for a seperate heating circuit. The TRZ-12W units are replaced by 

* a Shelly Plus 1PM with a Shelly Plus Addon
* a DS18B20 temperature sensor
* a button for a manual heating request
* a LED that indicates the heating (parallel to the valve)

The caldavHeatControl is used 

* to grab events from a calendar. Each room must have its own category (you can use multiple category entries per event)
* to request status updates from the Shellys with MQTT (temperature measurements, button-pressed events and relais status)
* to control the room temperatures on two levels (day = event pending, night = otherwise)
* to ensure that there is enough pre-heat time (for large rooms e.g. start heating 8 hours before an event)

The setup can be implemented on a Raspberry Pi. It requires the Linux packages (or installed via pip)

* python3-paho-mqtt
* python3-tz
* python3-caldav
